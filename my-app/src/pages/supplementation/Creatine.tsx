                    <p>Creatine is a combination of three different amino acids: glycine, arginine, and methionine.
                        It helps your muscles produce energy during heavy lifting or high-intensity exercise.
                        Creatine can increase muscle strength, help you work harder for longer in the gym, and give you a
                        bigger muscle pump. It's also very safe.</p>

                        Loading Phase: This involves taking approximately 20g of creatine per day (four servings of 5g) for five to seven days. 
                        The primary objective of the loading phase is to increase muscle creatine levels quickly.
                        Maintenance Phase: After the loading phase, you can maintain your creatine levels with a daily dose of 3-5 grams.
