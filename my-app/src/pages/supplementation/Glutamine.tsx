                    <p>Glutamine is an a-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins1.
                        It's the most abundant amino acid found in the body, made in the muscles and transferred by
                        the blood into different organ systems. Glutamine is a building block for making proteins in
                        the body and is also needed to make other amino acids and glucose. It plays a crucial role in a
                        variety of biochemical functions, including protein synthesis.
